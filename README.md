# TelecomChurnPrediction
Business Data Analytics, MTech Artificial Intelligence Project done by Delton Myalil and Garima Jain.

Churning or customer attrition is the situation where a customer belonging to a company will switch to its competition. We are given a dataset that contains the details of the customers of a telecommunications company that is experiencing a high churn ratio. The goal is to find out insights as to why the churn is happening and also to build a prediction model for the same. We did exploratory data analysis on the dataset and found out the trends and possible reasons to the churn ratio. Furthermore, we trained eleven models on the data and evaluated their performance to find out the best one suited for deployment. We finally built a decision tree classifier which is trained on the entire dataset to be deployed by the company to predict unseen data.
